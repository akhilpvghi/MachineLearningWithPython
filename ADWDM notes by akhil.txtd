Waeka tool and penta house software===>

Date warehouse ===>process of creating and using data 
		warehouse collecting it from heterogenous 
		source(external sources)

		===>very large collection of data base (can be in tera bytes(TB))

		===>data that we get must be normalised

		===>can not be imagine/Analysed in tabular form (can be any type of data)

		===>manage by Integration tool (Organised way)

		
Data Base==>set of information which can manage inforamtion

ETL===Extraction Transform Loading

ETL is short for extract, transform, load,
three database functions that are combined 
into one tool to pull data out of one database 
and place it into another database. Extract is the 
process of reading data from a database

Data mining


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-43

Introduction to Data mining ===>discovering or mining knowledge from large amount of data.

	===> Knowledge discovery data (also known as KDD)

	===>attempts to extract hidden pattern

	===>supports automatic exploration of data

Need--
	==> Extracting meaningful data
	==>finding hidden information
	==>to manually analyse large amount of data
	===>we need automatic analysis of data

Evolution of data mining
	==>statistics ---> consist regression analysis, cluster analysis, standard deviation etc. [lay the foundation of data mining]

	==>Artificial Inteligence (AI): Applying of human thoughts

	==>MAchine learning = union of AI and statistics
			===>learn from data



_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-52 -->Link analysis in Data mining

like airlines(like cities) etc.

===>useful for finding patterns in relationship

e.g bread with better...

Application
	==>Association Discovery
		==>support  and confidence

	==> Sequential Pattern Discovery(we also consider time in this discovery)
	
	==> SImilar time Sequence Discovery
		==>deriving sequence using another sequence



_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-51

Neural Networks ==>

	===>mimics the human brain by learning from training data set
		and applying the learning to generalise patterns for classification 
		and prediction.

i/p	weight		summarization unit

x1  ->	w1  ->		 process            

x2  ->  w2  ->

					

sum = X*W
     =summision of(xiwi)

Layers
	==>input layer ==>contains input unit
	==>Hidden layer ==>provide non linearity to the network
	==>Output layer 



_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-53

Genetic algorithm ===>similar to neural network
		====> every model competes with every inheriting traits from previous one
			until only the most predictive model survives

			e.g how many mail should be sent to grow business
			


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-12

K-means algorithm==>

==>e.g do it as ywo cluster

calculate eucledian distance

1) Initialise two clusters

	==>calculate centroid


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-27

Memory based resoning (data mining technique) ===>
	
		==>instances of a model to predict unkown instances
			==>maintains a dataset of known records
			==>ALgo knows the characteristics of the records in this training set
			==>when new record arrives for evaluation, the algo finds the neighbors to the new record, then uses characteristics of the neighbors for prediction and classification.

	-->distance between new records and records in the training data set is calculated

ISSUES
	===>finding suitable records
	===>establishing way to compose records
	===>distance function and combination functions


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-28

Decision Trees (Data mining major techniques)

	==>used to visually define rules which are simple interpreted and understood


	Root Node (Main Question)
	   |
	Branch Nodes (Intermediate nodes)
	   |
	Leaf Nodes (Answer)

factors
	==>Information gain ===>measure of how much the answwer to a specific question provides
	==>Entropy ===>measure of uncertainity there is in information

	###information gain is inversely proportional to entropy

e.g ID3 Algorithm
e.g credit score example

ISSUE
	==>finding splitting attribute

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-29

Clustering Detection(major data mining technique)
	===>unsupervised learning (we don't know the class labels and no. of labels)
	===>earliest data mining technique
	===>searches for similar data elements
	===>e.g. K-means cluster

	Distance measure
		==>Euclidean distance

Advantages of using clustering
	===>not affected by new object
	===>no need to worry about sign
	===>computation process is simple

Application of clustering
	===>Establish taxonomy of disease,cure and symptoms
	===>Social network communities
	===>Seismology ==>Epicentre of earthquake
	===>Business marketting==>targetted customer finding

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-12

K-Means clustering
	==>using eucledian distance divide into clusters

	===>observed value 
	===>centroid value

	==>after adding new point to cluster the centroid will change again

	==>centroid = (a+b)/2

OLAP -->introduced by E.F Codd

	===>analysing historic and time variant data

	===>complex data derived

	==>business datwarehouse

	==>can be alalysed by data mining, Analytics Decision making

	==>Information


FEATURES OF OLAP:-
	1) FAst

	2) Analysis: lets user to enter query in interactive tool
	
	3) Shared

	4) Multidimensional ===>measure and dimensional

	5) Information

OLTP-->characterised by large no. of short online transaction

	==>business process

	==>operations


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-38 (UNIT-2)

OLAP OPerations

	1) Pivoting ==>changing from one dimesion orientaion to another or ROTATION

	2) SLICE and DICE ==>   slice =>cross tabulation is done for specific value other than all for fixed third dimension
				dice ==>in dice two or more dimension are fixed

	3) ROll up and Drill down ==>roll up ==>individual to confined data==>finer granularity to confined data
				     drill down ==>confined data to finer granulaity (like breaking quarter into months)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-39 (UNIT-2)

Diff b/w OLTP and OLAP

OLTP

	==>very fast

	==>aim is to control & run basic business task

	==>highly normalised database

	==>simple and standard queries
OLAP

	==>speed depends on data

	==>decision support

	==>data in denormalised form

	==>deals with consolidated data(hetrogenous data source)

	complex queries with aggregation data


OLAP

	===>multidimensional

	===>transparency ==>to improve efficiency and production

	==>Accessibility ===>provides restricted access

	===>consisitency ===>handle managemnet when increases(should not effect other aspects)

	===>client server model

	==>Generic Dimensionality

	===>Dynamic sparse matrix (distribution of data dynamically)

	===>Multiuser 

	===>Unrestricted

	===>Intuitive manipulation

	===>FLexible



_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-45 (unit-3)

DAta Transformation (data cleaning aspect)
		==>it is data preprocessing technique that transforms or consolidate the data into 
		alternate forms appropraiate for mining


INVOLVED PROCESSES (# SANG)
	1) SMoothing: Removing the noise from data (binning, regression, clustering)

	2) Aggregation: Summary or aggregate function
			==>constructing a data cube (helps in OLAP)

	3) Generalization: low-level concepts are replaced with higher level

	4) Normalisation : Attributes value are normalised by scaling their values so that they fall in specified range.

			==> Normalisation methods
					
					1) Min-Max Normalisation: V' = (V-min(x))/max(x)-min(x)

					2) Z-Score Normalisation  ==>(zero mean normalisation) V' = V - (mean of attribute)/ standard deviation of attribute


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-49 (unit-3)

Dimensionality REDUCZTION

	==>it represents the original data in the compressed or redusec form by applying data encoding or transformation

		LOSSLESS ==>if original data can be reconstructed from compressed data without losing any information

		LOSSY	===> if reconstructed data is the approximation of compresses data

Numerosity Reduction 

	==>It reduces the data volume choosing smaller form of representation

		PARAMETRIC ==>only parameters of data and outliers are stored instead of actual data...e.g Regression, log-linear models

		NON-PARAMETRIC ===>data is stored in form of histograms, clustering, sampling etc


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-50 (unit-3)

Data Discertization: (concept hierarchy)

	==>divides range of attributes into intervals so as to reduce numer of values for a given continous attribute.

	TECHNIQUES
		
		==>Splitting : top-down(attribute is splitted into range of values)

		==>Merging : Bottom-up (initially we consider later remove some during merging)

		===>Supervised ==>class information is known

		===>Unsupervised ==>class information is not known


CONCEPT HIERARCHY

	===>it also helps in reducing data

	==>by replacing low-level concepts with higher level concepts.

	mobile no. and landline no. ==>low level

	telephone ===>higher level

how they are applicable on numerical data

	1) binning ===> sepearate in different bins

	2) Histogram

	3) CLuster analysis

Data mart ==>data store which is designed for a department of an organistaion, 
or data mart is subset of the D.W that is usually oriented to a specific purpose.

#diagram

Reason for Creating Data mart
	
	===>Easy Access of frequent data
	===>Improved end-user response time
	===>Easy creation of data mart
	===>Less cost

Different type of Data Mart

	DEPENDENT DATA MART: In this data mart is built by drawing data from central data datawarehouse that
				already exists.

	
	INDEPENDENT DATA MART: In this, the data mart is built by drawing from operational or
				external sources of data or both.

				==>Data mart is created without help of Data warehouse


ADVANTAGES OF DATA MART:

	1) Simpler, more focussed & flexible
	2) Low cost s/w and H/w
	3) Faster and cheaper to build
	4) stores data closer that enhances performance



Disadvantages of Data mart

1) unorganised development
2) difficult process of data access, cleansing
3) NOt much thorough design as data warehouse
4) increase in data mart size leads to problem such as performance
	degradation, data inconsistency.

Difference  between data warehouse and data mart


data warehouse
	==>corporate wise
	==>union of Data mart
	==>recives functions from staging area
	==>centralised control and management of data
	==>Keeps all historical data
	
data mart
	===>departmental wise
	==>subset of DW
	==>it has star join concept means fact and dimension
	==>Technology optimal for dat access and analysis
	==>STRUCTURED to suit the departmental view of data

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-21

STEPS IN IMPLEMENTING DATA MART (#MAP CD inverse way)

	Designing
		==>first step and covers all the task from initiating the request for data mart through gathering
		information about the requirement
			==>gathering business/technlogy information
			==>identifying data sources
			==>selecting appropriate subset of data
			==>Designing both logical/physical str.
	2) COnstructing		
		==>include creating physical database and logical structure associated with the data mart.
			==>creating db, tablespaces, other reltn
			==>creating schema object =>table,index.
			==>Determining best table access strategy.
	3) Populating (ETL)
		==>mapping of data sources 
		==>extracting the data
		==>cleansing and transforming the data
		==>loading the data

	4)Accesing 
		==>it involves putting the data to use
		==>frontend development
		==>maintainging and managing bussiness interfaces
		==>setting up db structure==>summarised table.

	5) Managing
		==>involves managing the data over its lifetime
			==>Secure access the data.
			==>Managing the growth of data
			==>optimising the system for better performance
			==>data availability

DATA WAREHOUSE

	NEED
		==>for taking quick and effective decision
		==>provides necessary information
		==>creating and managing efficient data repository


	GOAL OF Data warehouse
		===>secured and easy access of infon to user.
		==>consistent informationto be improved
		==>clean and authentic data for analysis
		==>collected data must be accurate, verified.
		==>data must be adaptive in nature
	
	ADVANTAGES
		==>historical informtn is provided to analyst.
		==>Increase quality of data
		==>helps in recovering from DB failure
		==>helps in data mining process


	BENEFITS
		==>increases in product inventory turnover
		==>decrease in cost of productn
		==increase sales with improved target market selection
		==>better business intelligence

Difficulties/problem

	1) construction of D.W for large organisation is a complex task 
		and can take years to complete(is accomodate to changes.)

	2) Administration of D.W is also complex and requires higher level skills and team with technical expertise.(complexity increase with size)


	3)Quality conrol of DW issues both quality and consistency of data.(data should be correct,clean and authentic)


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

L-24

Distributed DW

	==>Data are shared across multiple data repositries,
		for the purpose of OLAP and where each data warehouse
		may belong to one or more organisation.

	==>It covers a complete enterprise data warehouse but have tiny data that
		that are built seperately.

	==>These data stores are connected physically over a network to provide users access 
		to the relevant reports.

	==>It is the core of all enterprise data which is used to send relevant data to 
		individual data marts.

Categories of distributed data warehouse
	
	1)Local and global data	warehouse: 
		data is unique to local Operating system

		global is integrated data

	2) Technologically distributed DW:
		logically single data warehouse but physically 
		many distributed data warehouse 

	3) Independently evolving distributed DW:
		uncordinated environment DW ==(DW increases one by one)
		
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF Distributed DW

	1) Faster : local DW has its own control

	2) No Limits: 

	3) Cost is much less than centralised structure

Disadvantages of distributed DW

	1) Metadata : overhead increases (info of metadata) as data increases


	2)multiple development efforts


	3) The roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined
	4)Excessive network traffic starts
	5) coordinating development becomes complex and less effective

	6) Interconnectivity could be problematic in case of traffic congetion

Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

Extracting
	==>it is process to collect data from various source then transform and then load
	==>1st is extracting the data==>brought up from external sources
	==>Involves connecting to source, collecting necessary data needed for analytical processing.

	problems:  Data integrity(different names for same thing)

Transforming

	==>fit the data as std.
	==>series of steps are performed on extracted data to convert into standard format.
	==>conversion, cleaning duplicates, filtering the data, standardizing the data



Loading
	==>send the data to warehouse
	==>imports transformed data into large database or date warehouse


# diagram

data sources ==>ETL ==>Data warehouse staging ==>Data warehouse ====> then into different Data mart



Comparison of OLTP and data warehouse

data warehouse

	==>Adhoc queries(we dont know intially but on run time)
	==>regular updation using ETL tools (may be monthly)
	==>generally uses denormalised data
	==>Query accesses thousand or millions of records
	==>store historical data

OLTP 
	==>supports only predefined operations
	==>always upto date
	==>fully normalised data
	==>few records at a time
	==>No historical data

		==>large size
		==>pure fact table is collection of forigner key

Dimension table

		==>character value(like book name)
		===>Each dimension table has its own primary key
		==>context/descriptive information
		==>smaller than fact table
		Pure dimension table is collecytion of primary key

DATA WAREHOUSE SCHEMA
	==>schema is a collection of database object, including tables, views, indexes etc

1) STAR SCHEMA OR STAR JOIN SCHEMA :- It consist of FACT Table with a single table for each dimension(dimension table)

Advantages
	==>Simplest and easiest 
	==>it optimizes the navigation through DB
	==>SImple queries
	==>Suitable for query processing

SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA
	==>cariation of star schema , which has multi level of simension table.[Dimesion tables are normalised]

Advantages

	==>less redundance due to normalised dimension table
	==>Dimesion table are easier to maintain

Disadvantages==>complex schema


FACT CONSTELLATION SCHEMA
	==>also known as galaxy schema. In this multiple FACT Tables shares the DIMENSION TABles

disadv
==>complex as it is having multiple fact tables
==>difficult to manage
==>Dimesiona tables are very large

STAR v/s SNOWFlake schema

Star 
	==>highly denormalised
	==>category wise single dimension table
	==>more data dependency and redundancy
	no need of complicated join

SNowflake

	==>normalised (in dimesion table)
	==>dimension table further splits into additional table
	==>less data dependency and redundancy
	===>complicated joins are required

Type of keys in STAR SCHEMA

PRIMARY KEYS: Each row in a domension table is identified by a unique
	value of attributes designated as primary key of the dimension.

SURROGATE KEYS: The surrogate keys are simply  system generated sequence numbers.
		===>no built-in meanings

FOREIGN KEYS: Primary keyof each dimension table must be a froreign key in 
	the fact table.
