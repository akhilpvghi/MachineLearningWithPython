S1E1

Diffie hellman key exchange algorith

if key can be send directly then why not message ....?

==>Key exchange algorithm

	==>deffie hellman ==>two mathematician

		==>to exchange key

		==>let p,q be two prime numbers (public)
			
			X = p^r mod q
			K = Y^r mod q

S2E1 (BLock cipher)

Data encryption standars

==>satellite view of algorithm (diagram)

	==>we work on chunk of data

	Steps in DES
	
	1) initial permutation	==>transpose or shuffle or to change position acc. to fixed key (like first key go 38th position) ==>new chunk is formed

	2) 16 feistel rounds (eacg feistel has its own key) ==>

		64bit permuted text ==>divide in two blocks==>left and right 

		==>right block is passed through fn(heart of DES) along with 48 bit key and result is absorbed with left block

			==>fn(heart of DES)

				==>1) Expansion (32 bit) to 48bit
					
					==>divide into 8 blocks (of 4 bit each)
						==>conver each block of 4 bit to 6 bit (hence now 48)
						==>last is first and first is last while converting

				==>xor with 48 bits

				==>substitute box(s-box)
					==>divide 48 into 8 blocks
					==>first and last digit will give row no.
					==>in between ==column no. will be calculated
					==>calculate row no and column no
					==>s box table

	3) left right swap

	4) final permutation


// what happened to 64 bit key 

drop parity bit(8,16,24....position bits)

	==>now 28 bit each

	==>rotate shift left and right to both block resp

At round 1,2,9,16 = 1 bit shift
rest all = 2 bit shift



plain text ---> cipher text

==>double DES can also be performed

==>triple des ==>encrypt ==>decrypt with another key ==>then encrypt
