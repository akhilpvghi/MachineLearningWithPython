S1E1

Container service ..?

==>setup and configuration

	==>will create user

		=>>will create role (in IAM=> Identity and Access management)

		==>==>will create Key

		==>VPC for our cluster (virtual private cluster)

		==>AWS CLI

	==>Component and usage

		==>cluster

		==>container instance

		==>the agent

		==>scheduling task

		==>Repositries

		==>IAM policies and roles

Conclusion

	==>Troubleshooting

		==>through AWS console

		==>logging and service limits

		==>conclusion and summary

summary

	==>manage safety

S1E2

What is container?

	==>are virtual machine

	==>emulation of specific computer type

	==>underlying guest operating system

	==>isolation of system from within

	==>manage it from the instances


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
S1E3

COntainer architecture

		==>will also talk about docker
		
		==>docker is like wrapper 

			==>communicates via socket or rest api..

			docker componenet
				
				==>Daemon
				==>client
				==>docker.io registry


			in VM architecture===>server ==>HOST OS ==>hypervisor ==>on which multiple VM can run

			==>in container architecture ==>application runs on docker engine

Amazon Ec2 Container service

	
	what makes up the ECS??

		==>CLusters

		==>Container Instances
			==>EC2 Instances

		==>Task Definition
			
	
		==>Scheduling
			==>how to get our tasks

		==>Services
			==>to maintain no. of instances

		==>Task
			==>instance of task definition

		==>COntainers
			==>linux container(docker for example) which is create as part of task


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
S2E1

Amazon ECS ec2 container

	==>on linux system

create user group and then user ==>to get security in some way

go to ==>aws.console management

	==>under security & identity

		==>identify & Access management

			==>go to dashboard

				==>go to user

					==>set up new user

						name: ecsadmin

						==>will get key

						==>show security credential

							==>get access key id
								and secret access key 

							==>download credential ==>to setup command line later

							==>we will get csv file

							==>copy that key, only one time will be shown as key

					==>now go to group

						==>create group

						==>name : ecsadmins

							==>attach policy==>adiminstrator Acess

							==>now add user to that group ==>so we dont have manage at user level


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
S2E2

==>signing up with free account

amazon web services console ==>root account

	==>users

		ecsadmin

			==>security credential

				=>sign in credential

					==>manage password

						==>asign a custom pasword
							==>it will ask for new password everytime , I suppose
							==>create account allias

						==>copylink from dashboard

						==>then go to other browser

							==>user will create new user and password

							==>now this new user will see its new console

							==>like we did assign granular access

S2E3

continue with EC2 container service

	==>remember we have csv file of credential to access cli

	==>using ssh

	==>we will use pem file with ssh

	=>to create that

		==>login to any of our user

		aws.console.management

		==>go to EC2 virtual server

			==>in left

				==>go to network and security
					==>go to key pairs

				==>create key pair

				==>key pair name: ecsadmin-key-pair-us-oregon

				==>click create

				==>browser will ask to download

		==>we have to associate key with some instance

		==>we can have IP of instance once when its started

		==>ssh -->agent needs to be added like bash

		==>then add ssh key to that agent

		==>add your identity with ssh i key_path user@IP

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
S2E4

console.aws.amazon.com

	==>create VPC for use for our cluster

	==>go to VPC ==>create VPC(VIrtual private cloud)

		==>name tag: ECS_VPC

		==>CIDR block: 10.17.0.0/16

		tenancy ==>dedicated ==>no ip will be there for anyone (will cost)
			==>default ==>will be free

			there will  always be default VPC with 172.31.0.0/16

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
S2E5

security group and ECS instances (like firewall)

	==>go to ECS container service ==>can have one video

	==>go to EC2 in dashboard
	
		==>in network and security

			==>go to security groups

				==>now we want like firewall service for all instance

			==>create security group

				security group name: ecs-sg-oregon
				description:	US Oregon security group

				VPC: 

				inpound: is like incoming

				type: SSH
				protocol: TCP
				port rannge: 22
				source : anywhere 0.0.0.0/0
				
				click add rule for inbound

				outbound

				TYPE: SSH(20) or HTTP(80) or HTTPS(443)
				protocol: TCP
				
			==>to secure limited SSH type

configuration options

	==>setup command line interface

	==>sudo yum install epel-release

		==>//we can download in epel repository

		==>sudo yum update

		==>sudo yum install python-pip

		==>sudo pip install awccli

		==>which aws

		==>aws cofigure

			==>access key ID

			==>access secret key

			==>region name : us-west-2

			==>format : default json

		==>aws ec2 describe-regions


==============================
		==>ls *.csv

aws.amazon.com/ecs/home ==>lab lab...

EC2 container service wizard

	==>ECS is EC2 container service

	task definition name: ecs-sample-web-app-static

	container name: ecs-sample-web

	==>instance within cluster

S3 ==>scalable storage ==>quite cheaper

EC2
	==>Instances

terminal
	>>clear
	>>ls -al *pem
	>>ll
	>>ssh-agent bash
	>>ssh-add _file.pem
		==>if error
	then >>chmod 600 _file.pem
	>>ssh-add _file.pem
	>>ssh -i _file.pem ec2-user@IP_addr

		==>error connection time out==>as we are using default security

		==>lets change

==connection timeout error
	thugh instance is running on browser
	==>what if we need to change the build

Ec2 scaling is like ==>creating new same instance with different task

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
S3E6

EC2 container service
		==>distribute load since it is scaled

		load balancer uses ==>round robin

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
S3E7

docker is like git like to manage version

>>docker --version
>>docker images

==>hub.docker.com
