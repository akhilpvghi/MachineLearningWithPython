Intro to network and cryptography

___________________________________________________________________

S1E1


networking

	==>conection of more than one node

OSI model

	==>physical layer
		=>cables and wires
		=>

	==>data link ==>
		
		==>bytes into frames
		==>MAC address(cant be changes, spoofing is different)
	==>Network

		==>using IP address
		==>logical address

	==>Transport

		==>manage and control
		==>TCP and UDP
		==>TCP guaranteed
		==>UDP ==>Unreliable
		==>split commnication into packages

	==>session 
		==>traffic control
		==>coordinate communication
		==>when and how much to send
		


	==>presentation

		==>format data
		==>Encryption/Decryption

	==>application
		==>SMTP
		==>HTTP
		==>FTP

S1E2

IP address 
	==>logical address
	==>based on router

	types
		==>public IP
			===>showing outside world

		==>private IP
			==>within router
IPV4
	==>32 bit address
	==>4 set of 8 binaries
	
	cons.
		==>only 4 billion addresses
		==>and we have tooo many connected devices

IPV6
	==>128 bit address
	==>:: ==>means 4 hexadecimal zeroes

S1E4

MAC Address

	==>Media Access Controller
	==>unique physical address
	==>ipconfig /all
	==>macvendorlookup.com
	==>to get IP

UNICAST
	==> 1 to 1

multicast
	==>1 to many

broadcast
	any computer in braodcast domain

S2E1

Routing and switching

	Hub
		==>dump device
		==>receive data and sends to everyone


	Switch
		==>smart hub
		==>track MAC


	Repeater
		==>making signal stronger
		==>Amplify
		==>clean up signals(reduces inteferances)
		
		
	ROuter
		==>real smart devices
		==>manages traffic flow
		==>has two IP addresses
		==>many have built in routers
		==>DHCP server built in

S2E3

TCP/IP

	==>coomon protocols between two device
	==>in order to communicate

___________________________________________________________________

S2E4

TCP vs UPD

	TCP

		==>Transmission control protocol
		==>one to one
		==>3 way handshake (before connection establishment)
		
		==>in one direction
		
		TCP packets
			20 bytes header and (dynamic)bytes body
	UDP
		==>not limited to one - n - one connection
		==>no three way handshake
		==>no verify connection
		==>like streaming

Wireshark network analysis

==>wireshark.org

___________________________________________________________________

S3E1

wireshark and protocol

  ==>see packets as TCP and UDP 

___________________________________________________________________

S3E2

Ports and protocols

	65,535 ports per connection

	FTP : 21
	SFTP:22
	SMTP: 25
	POP3: 110
	HTTP: 80
	HTTPS: 443
		==>encrypted http
		==>certificate between client/server

S3E3

DNS (Domain name server)

	Fully Qualified DOmain name (FQDN) ==>IP

S4E1

Wifi Security

Wireless Encryption
	
	==>WEP(Wired Equivalent Privacy)
		==>easily broken
		
	==>WPA (wifi Protected access)
		==>temporary enhancement

	==>WPA2 (wifi Protected access 2)
		==>use AES- Advanced Encryption Standard

S4E2

VPN (Virtual private network)

	==>tunnel/encrypted connection over a public network

	Types

	Client to Site(VPN)
		==>remote access VPN
	
	Site to Site(VPN)
		
___________________________________________________________________

S4E3

VPN - uses web protocol

	==>SSL (Secure socket layer) ==>oldest one
			==>web based vpn HTTPS
			==>based on certificates
			==>Old school now
			
	==>TLS==>Transport layer security
			==>certificates
			
	==>TLS 1.2
			==>Enhanced Security
			==>Tighter security
			
L2TP =>Layer 2 Tunneling protocol

S4E4

IP sec ==>IP security

		==>has 5 sub protocols
		
			==>ESP(Encapsulating Security Payload)
			==>AH(Authentication Header)
			==>IPcomp 
			==>IKE(internet key exchange)
			

___________________________________________________________________

S4E5

Authentication

		==>proving who we are
		
Multi factor authentication

	==>something you have
	==>something you are
	==>something you know
	
	==>SSO (Single sign on)
		==>like login google everywhere

S5E1

Encryption 

	==>plain text to cipher text
	==>only key and passphrases are getting changed
	
	
___________________________________________________________________

Data Hashing

	==>one way mathematical algorithm
	
	==>Like a fingerprint
	
	==>File verification/PKI
	
	==>Password Hashing
	
	
___________________________________________________________________

S5E5

Data hashing is also used in PKI (Public key Infrastructure)

S5E7

Public key Infrastructure(PKI)
		==>based on Asyymetric
		
		CA authority ==>is trusting party for both party ==>Root authority
		
		CA will sign their private key with their public key
		
		==>then other third party will ask CA to decrypt
