what is Reinforcement Learning??

 #visualize maze==>agent(AI)==>performs action==>(state,reward)==>again n again==>and learning

=====>


====>like not to speed car at pathway ===>learning by traffic police

=====>or like we give biscuit to dog when he does good

===>in AI rewards are digital

===========>simple Reinforcement Learning with tenserflow==>10 parts

Reinforcement learning I: by richard sutton (1998)

S3E8

the bellman equation (Richard ernest Bellman)

==>s- state
==>a- action
==>R- Reward
==>Y(gamma)- Discount

maze in which there is fire having reward = -1

and goal==>reward = +1

V(S) = max(R(s,a) + YV(s')) ===>to not confused at corner of maze if v=1 of all box from start to goal

S = curret_state

Theory of dynamic programming by Richard bellman (paper)--->30 july 1954

S3E9

the plan====>replace value with direction ?

________________________________________________________________________________

S3E10

Markov Decission Process(MDP)

deterministic search  V/s non-determinitic search

environment===>apply frame ==>use MDP



V(S) = max(R(s,a) + YV(s1' | s2' |s3')probability) ===>to not confused at corner of maze if v=1 of all box from start to goal

S3E11

Policy Vs Plan

===>non deterministic search==>

===>now we will also consider that negative stops will have lower value....

Living Penalty

reward value needs to be calculated carefully===>

S3E13

Q-Learning=====>

Q(s,a) = R(s,a)+ Y<<P(s,a s')max(Q(s',a'))
