Our main objective is to conduct fair exam remotely and notify students and exam cell head if any undesired activity seems to take place so that proper response of questions attempted by user/candidate can be provided to the Examination Department. 
The person should be physically himself/herself present and their should no other unfair practices can be done like switching of the multiple tabs , restriction of undesired keys like copy, paste etc. and for security issues while updating the result(attendance) on the server.}
